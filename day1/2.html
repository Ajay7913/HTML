    Iran has scrapped its ‘morality police’ after more than two months of protests triggered by the arrest of Mahsa Amini for allegedly violating the country’s strict female dress code, local media said Sunday.
    
    Women-led protests, labelled "riots" by the authorities, have swept Iran since the 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin died on September 16, three days after her arrest by the morality police in Tehran.</p>
    

    <p>The morality police – known formally as the Gasht-e Ershad or "Guidance Patrol" – were established under hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to "spread the culture of modesty and hijab", the mandatory female head covering.

        The units began patrols in 2006.</p>
